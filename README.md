# Bucket-List-Scrapbook
Helping you kick the bucket with style and intention

## Description

This website is the result of a casual meeting between the four developers.  While brainstorming, developer one said, "I just got back from the Sounders game."  Developer two said, "Oh you know I've never been!"  To which developer three said, "You gotta add it to your bucket list!"  And Bucket List Scrapbook was born.

The movitivation for this site was to create a friendly and fun space for users to become intentional about kicking the bucket.  We all have things we want to do, places we want to go, and people we want to meet.  Let's get intentional about it.  

The developers built this project to create an application for users to save their bucket list items in one place, to have some fun generating new ideas, and to get the satisfaction of checking things off their list.  The scrapbook is an additional space to reflect on what the user has accomplished.

The developers learned how to create a clean, responsive, and interactive application.  We learned how to better utilize APIs and incorporate data to bring another level of sophistication to a website.  We learned the importance of local storage and good uses for it.  We learned a new-to-us CSS framework.

Perhaps most importantly, we learned how to colloborate as a team of developers.  The planning process, wireframing, pseudocoding, and kanban is integral to a smooth development process.  Whenever we got stuck, we could revisit our plan and refocus.  We learned the Git Work Flow and the importance of commiting early and often.  

## Installation

There are no installation requirements.  We recommend the user save Bucket List Scrapbook to their bookmarks for quick access.

## Usage

User's can access Bucket List Scrapbook at https://rachlally.github.io/bucket-list/ .

This page is user friendly with a clean, modern look.  At the landing page, the user will be greeted with a header including a Navigation Bar to easily access different locations of the site.  Locations include: What is Bucket List Scrapbook, Your Bucket List, Your Scrapbook, and About Us (the developers!).  Clicking on any link will scroll the user to the desired location.

The first section includes a brief introduction on how the user can best use the site.

The next section is Your Bucket List.  In this section, the user creates a list of their bucket list items.  If they need inspiration, there are two options.  First, the "Fill My Bucket" button will randomly generate an activity idea for the user to consider.  If uninterested in the activity, simply click again for a new option.  Second, there is an interactive Google Map.  The user can grab the avatar from the bottom right corner, drop it anywhere on the map.  The user can then explore the pin dropped area to see if they want to add that location or point of interest to their bucket list.  The user can add as many items as they want.  As items are completed, the user can click "I did it!", removing the completed item from their bucket list.

The third section is Your Scrapbook.  The user has completed their bucket list item and now they must document!  The user can title their activity and include a description about what they did, who they were with, and how they felt checking that bucket list item off their list.

The last section includes a little about us, the developers.  Maybe the user will find inspiration in our personal bucket list items.

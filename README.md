# Bucket-List-Scrapbook
Helping you kick the bucket with style and intention

## Description

This website is the result of a casual meeting between the four developers.  While brainstorming, developer one said, "I just got back from the Sounders game."  Developer two said, "Oh you know I've never been!"  To which developer three said, "You gotta add it to your bucket list!"  And Bucket List Scrapbook was born.

The movitivation for this site was to create a friendly and fun space for users to become intentional about kicking the bucket.  We all have things we want to do, places we want to go, and people we want to meet.  Let's get intentional about it.  

The developers built this project to create an application for users to save their bucket list items in one place, to have some fun generating new ideas, and to get the satisfaction of checking things off their list.  The scrapbook is an additional space to reflect on what the user has accomplished.

The developers learned how to create a clean, responsive, and interactive application.  We learned how to better utilize APIs and incorporate data to bring another level of sophistication to a website.  We learned the importance of local storage and good uses for it.  We learned a new-to-us CSS framework.

Perhaps most importantly, we learned how to colloborate as a team of developers.  The planning process, wireframing, pseudocoding, and kanban is integral to a smooth development process.  Whenever we got stuck, we could revisit our plan and refocus.  We learned the Git Work Flow and the importance of commiting early and often.

## Discription
Bucket List Scrapbook is a place where you can brainstorm bucket list items, complete them and store photos of your experiences! Bucket List Scrapbook is all about making memories by doing the things you've always wanted to do or by doing something that you would have never done in the first place. You can create a diary entry for each list item. On our site you can even show the location of where you've completed each Bucket List experience.

## Installation

There are no installation requirements.  We recommend the user save Bucket List Scrapbook to their bookmarks for quick access.

## Usage

User's can access Bucket List Scrapbook at https://rachlally.github.io/bucket-list/ .

This page is user friendly with a clean, modern look.  At the landing page, the user will be greeted with a header including a Navigation Bar to easily access different locations of the site.  Locations include: What is Bucket List Scrapbook, Your Bucket List, Your Scrapbook, and About Us (the developers!).  Clicking on any link will scroll the user to the desired location.

The first section includes a brief introduction on how the user can best use the site.

The next section is Your Bucket List.  In this section, the user creates a list of their bucket list items.  If they need inspiration, there are two options.  First, the "Fill My Bucket" button will randomly generate an activity idea for the user to consider.  If uninterested in the activity, simply click again for a new option.  Second, there is an interactive Google Map.  The user can grab the avatar from the bottom right corner, drop it anywhere on the map.  The user can then explore the pin dropped area to see if they want to add that location or point of interest to their bucket list.  The user can add as many items as they want.  As items are completed, the user can click "I did it!", removing the completed item from their bucket list.

The third section is Your Scrapbook.  The user has completed their bucket list item and now they must document!  The user can title their activity and include a description about what they did, who they were with, and how they felt checking that bucket list item off their list.

The last section includes a little about us, the developers.  Maybe the user will find inspiration in our personal bucket list items.

To help you kick the bucket in style




# 07 Project 1: Interactive Front-End Application

At the conclusion of each phase of this course, you’ll work with a group of your fellow students to create a **project**. A project is collaborative work among a group of developers to create an application that solves a real-world problem. Projects model the experience you’ll encounter in every development role at any company, from large multinational businesses to small startups. Coding is collaborative.

A project is a bit different from the Challenge assignments you’ve worked on so far. One of the biggest differences is that you’ll no longer build an application by yourself! This has some advantages&mdash;you won’t have to do all of the work, you can divide up duties, and you can share skills and knowledge with other developers and lean on their strengths. This can also be challenging if you’re used to working alone. Constant communication and time management are just two of the skills you’ll need to practice to make sure everyone in your group works together to complete the project. 

Projects won’t provide you with a user story or acceptance criteria, because you and your group will create them once you decide which real-world problem your application will solve. This lack of constraints can be freeing in a way, because you have room to build what you want, but it also means that you have to decide what those constraints are before you can start working.

Finally, a project requires a presentation, because you’re trying to convince an audience that it serves a purpose. Your instructional staff and fellow students are investors, and you’re pitching your creation to them&mdash;an experience that developers are required to do frequently. Your presentation is just as important as the actual project, so take it just as seriously.

## Project Requirements

You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past six modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Presentation Requirements

* Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?

* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?

* Demo: Show your stuff!

* Directions for Future Development

* Links to the deployed application and the GitHub repository
